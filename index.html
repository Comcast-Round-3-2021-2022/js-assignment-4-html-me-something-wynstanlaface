                  the infamous shootout, it will interest readers to know that he also scored the last penalty delivering Chelsea's <br>

                  <p> I call him the good bully, this is because he as a target man will do all it takes to get past a defender to score <br>
                  ...that is his J.O.B!!! He won the <a href="https://www.premierleague.com"> Premier league</a> in his first season with Chelsea, winning the Golden Boot Award (Top Scorer) <br>

                  <p> How can we talk about Chelsea, a team currently owned by an American Business man, and not mention the man many call <br>
                  Captain America! Born in Hersey, Pennsylvania. This man can literally dribble himself. He is one of the leagues fastest players.<br>
               He plays some mouth watering soccer, you must see him play!</p>
